# 📊 COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes the global impact of COVID-19 across selected countries using data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data). It includes visualizations and insights on confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccination progress.

## 🚀 Goals

- Analyze trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths.
- Compare country-level data (India 🇮🇳, USA 🇺🇸, Kenya 🇰🇪).
- Visualize vaccination rollout over time.
- Calculate and interpret death rates.
- Present insights using charts and summary statistics.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** [Our World in Data - COVID-19](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress)
- **File Used:** `owid-covid-data.csv`

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (Kaggle Notebooks)

## 📈 Visualizations

- **Line Charts:** Total cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time.
- **Bar Charts:** Top countries by vaccination rate.
- **Heatmaps:** (Optional) Correlation analysis between variables.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- The USA had the highest total case count throughout the period.
- India showed a rapid increase in vaccinations after initial delay.
- Kenya recorded relatively lower numbers, likely due to limited testing and reporting.
- Death rates generally decreased as vaccination rates increased.
- Data completeness varied by country; some columns were interpolated or filled.
